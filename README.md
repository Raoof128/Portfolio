# Raouf.sh Portfolio

> **Cyber-ops Command Centre for Security & Software Engineering**

A high-performance, accessible, and security-credible portfolio built for recruiters and the security community. Designed with a "cyber-ops" aesthetic but behaving like a fast, professional product site.

## 🛡️ North Star
- **Proof > Personality**: Grounded in real artifacts, READMEs, and demos.
- **Fast > Flashy**: Quick load times, Lighthouse-optimized, no unnecessary gimmicks.
- **Security-First**: Built with security headers, privacy-by-design, and best practices.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: CSS Transitions + Framer Motion (for micro-interactions)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Verification**: `security.txt` compliance

## 📑 Features
- **Project Case Studies**: Eng-doc style write-ups focused on Problem/Solution/Build/Secure phases.
- **The Lab**: Deep-dives into systems programming, eBPF visibility, and security research.
- **Build | Secure Signature**: Dual-perspective analysis for every featured project.
- **Interactive HUD**: Real-time system status and tech-stack visibility panels.
- **Performance Optimized**: Click-to-load video facades and minimal client-side JS.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- `/projects`: Detailed walkthroughs of core tools like Mehr Guard, GitSwitch, and ECRSM.
- `/lab`: Systems engineering research logs.
- `/write-ups`: Professional postmortems and security detection notes.
- `/.well-known/security.txt`: Standardized security contact information.
