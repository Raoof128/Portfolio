## 📌 Featured Work

This portfolio showcases deep-dives into three main engineering pillars:

### 🛡️ [Mehr Guard](https://github.com/Raoof128/Raoof128.github.io)
**Privacy-first QR & Link Security.** 
- Built with Kotlin Multiplatform (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web).
- 100% Offline Phishing Detection using ensemble ML and 25+ heuristics.
- Developed at Macquarie University.

### 🔄 [GitSwitch](https://github.com/Raoof128/GitSwitch)
**Context-aware Git identity manager.**
- Modern desktop app built with Electron, React 19, and TypeScript.
- AI-powered semantic commit generation (Gemini 3).
- Secure OS-keychain storage and multi-account switching.

### 👁️ [ECRSM](https://github.com/Raoof128/ECRSM)

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind The Portfolio

This project is a demonstration of modern web standards and "Professional Ops" design.

- **Core**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React 19, TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom "Cyber-ops" design system.
- **Aesthetics**: Custom scanline animations, radial HUD grids, and glassmorphism.
- **Security**: 
  - `security.txt` compliance (RFC 9116).
  - Strict security headers and privacy-first defaults.
  - Static-first delivery for minimal attack surface.
- **Performance**: Click-to-load asset facades and optimized Lighthouse scores.
